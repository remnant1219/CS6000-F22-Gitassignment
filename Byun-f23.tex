%% For managing citations, it is recommended to use bibliography

%% You can then either use BibTeX with the ACM-Reference-Format style,

My goals for this course are to learn what is research, how to go deeper to understand the research topic, how to find papers related to my research topic through Google Scholar, and how to make the story about my paper. I actually have had the experience of submitting papers at some conferences. I realize it is difficult to make story that reviewers should accept the paper. I hope to understand how to make the story of papers in this class and improve my skills to search for good papers. I am studying the Ph.D.: Security. I am interested in security because in the future, the security field will be more important and more desirable for systems when I am studying for Bachelorâ€™s degree. I wanted to study security field more deeply and I searched a master's degree in South Korea. However, I cannot find any master's degree related to security in South Korea. Therefore, I decided to study in the USA. I got a master of degree: information assurance at Regis University. It can provide answers to some questions of security and hacking but it is not full for me to provide answers. So I decided to study more because Ph.D degree should provide me what I am curious about security. During Ph.D at UCCS. I find the answers to my questions and explain them through writing the papers.
